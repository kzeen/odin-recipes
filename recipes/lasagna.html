    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that has become a beloved comfort food worldwide. This hearty and flavorful casserole is renowned for its layers of pasta, rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and melted cheese. The dish is assembled in a deep baking dish, with each layer contributing to the overall indulgence of the final product. The name "lasagna" actually refers to both the pasta sheets used in the dish and the completed layered creation itself.</p>
    <p>To prepare a delicious homemade lasagna, start by making a savory meat sauce. A blend of ground beef, onions, garlic, tomatoes, tomato paste, and a medley of herbs and spices come together to form a robust and aromatic base. Meanwhile, prepare a velvety béchamel sauce by combining butter, flour, and milk to create a smooth, creamy texture. The pasta sheets are usually boiled until al dente before layering begins.</p>
    <p>Assembling the lasagna involves strategically layering the pasta sheets with the meat sauce, béchamel, and generous amounts of shredded mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. This delightful medley is then baked in the oven until the cheese becomes golden and bubbly, creating a mouthwatering masterpiece. The result is a comforting, family-friendly dish that satisfies both the palate and the soul, making it a timeless favorite for gatherings and cozy dinners alike.</p>
