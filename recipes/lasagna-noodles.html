    <h2 class="recipe-h2">Description</h2>
    <p class="recipe-p">Creating homemade lasagna noodles is a rewarding culinary endeavor that elevates the classic dish to a new level of freshness and flavor. Crafting your own pasta sheets allows you to tailor the texture and thickness to your preference, resulting in a lasagna that is uniquely yours. To make homemade lasagna noodles, you'll need basic ingredients like all-purpose flour, eggs, and a pinch of salt.</p>
    <p class="recipe-p">Begin by forming a well with the flour on a clean surface, crack the eggs into the well, and gradually incorporate the flour into the eggs until a dough forms. Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic, then allow it to rest for about 30 minutes, allowing the gluten to relax. Next, roll out the dough into thin sheets, ensuring they are evenly shaped.</p>
    <p class="recipe-p">Traditionally, lasagna noodles are cut into rectangular shapes, matching the dimensions of the baking dish. However, you can also get creative and experiment with different shapes and sizes for a unique presentation. Boil the freshly made noodles until they reach the desired level of doneness, typically al dente, and then layer them in your lasagna as you assemble the dish.</p>
    <p class="recipe-p">The result of using homemade lasagna noodles is pasta with a delightful chewiness and a rich, wheaty flavor that enhances the overall taste and authenticity of the dish. The effort put into making your own pasta sheets will undoubtedly be appreciated by those fortunate enough to savor your homemade lasagna.</p>
